| :warning:   | All "Live-Poll" repos are not maintained anymore. It is a student project carried out in 2021 by us (three students) at uni. It showed us how to apply common software engineering best-practices as well as project management techniques. Our code (except for the logo) is available under the very permissive MIT-license, so feel free to continue the project on your own. |
|---------------|:-------------------------|

We had a lot of fun during the six months developing Live-Poll from the ground-up, starting with a simple idea and turning it into a working web-app with frontend and backend. Users can register for free with their e-mail address and create new polls with different questions (e.g. multiple choice, open answer with a text field). In the live presentation mode, your audience can scan a QR code and easily answer your questions on their smartphones. Statistics are shown in real-time on the presenters monitor (that you probably want to project onto a wall). We use web sockets to accomplish this feature.

**A teaser video for Live-Poll can be found [here](https://youtu.be/MASfXASxLkU).** The app was hosted on live-poll.de, however we discontinued the project in the end of 2021 (see the disclaimer above).

All of our code (but not our logo) is hosted under the very permissive MIT-license. Feel free to make any changes you want to your fork or local copy of this project. Or just browse through the code to gain some inspiration.
